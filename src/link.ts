const TITLE = "Yo, check it, fam!  Pollinations.ai just dropped a bomb update, and we're talking serious glow-ups for your AI game.  Forget clunky UIs, we've got dual names and sweet tooltips now, plus DeepSeek V3.2 is living its best life on Vertex AI, and Onyx, the AI Storyboard Engine, is here to spice up your chats.  We even got dynamic pricing from Tinybird so you know what's up, and new BYOP docs, 'cause who doesn't love bringing their own pollen?  It's all going down on January 9th, 2026, and if you're not already registered at enter.pollinations.ai for these insane AI features, you're seriously missing out, no cap.";
